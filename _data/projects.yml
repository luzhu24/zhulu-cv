- name: Study on the dynamics of vortices with a vortex tracking algorithm - VATIP 
  id: project2
  description: >
    The dynamics and statistics of turbulence are highly influenced by vortices. With the newly developed vortex tracking algorithm, we sort through all kinds of vortices and study the influece of polymers on the shape of vortices. The project is supervised by Dr. Li Xi.

- name: Understanding of polymer-turbulence interfactions in polymeric flows
  id: project3
  description: >
    Adding a small amount of polymers into the polymeric turbulence can drastically reduce the flow friction drag and enhance transportation efficiency. This project targets to understand the complex polymer-vortex-turbulence interactions using some numerical tools, e.g., DNS and mechine learning. The project is supervised by Dr. Li Xi.
