### Hi, I'm Lu Zhu ðŸ‘‹
I am a Research Associate at Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambrdige. My current focuses of research are the numerical modeling of stratified flow in an inclined duct. We hope to better understand the transition and mixing of stratified flows in our work. My Ph.D. project at Department of Chemical Engineering, McMaster University studied polymer-vortex interactions and viscoelastic turbulence in plane channel flows.

My research interests include:

Computational fluid dynamics; Polymer materials; Stratified flows; Complex fluids and flows; Turbulence; Artificial Intelligent; Optimization; High performance computing.
