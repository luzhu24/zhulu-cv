Lu Zhu a Research Associate at DAMTP, University of Cambrdige. His current focuses of research are the nuermical modeling of stratified flow in an inclined duct. Before that, he is a Postdoc Fellow at McMaster University, focusing on industrial reactor scale-up. Lu Zhu earned his Ph.D. (2019) from McMaster University. His project targeted to understand the complex polymer-vortex-turbulence interactions in plane channel flows. He got a M.S. (2015) and a B.E. (2012) at East China University of Science and Technology.

Lu's current research interests include computational fluid dynamics, polymer materials, stratified flows, complex fluids and flows, turbulence, artificial Intelligent, optimization, high performance computing. He has authored over 10 publications.
